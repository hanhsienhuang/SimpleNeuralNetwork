# Simple Neural Network
This is a personal project implementing neural network and stochastic gradient descent written in C++. The task is to classify the MNIST handwritten digit dataset.

## Download MNIST dataset
Download and extract the files from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ into the folder `data`.

Change the file names as described below.

train-images-idx3-ubyte -> training-images
train-labels-idx3-ubyte -> training-labels
t10k-images-idx3-ubyte -> testing-images
t10k-labels-idx3-ubyte -> testing-labels

## Usage
Compile the code with `make` and run the experiment with `./run`.
